## Introduction

By using online data provided by the french governement we can process many ".csv" files.


# How it works ?

I decided to use python to fetch the data because the csv module is very easy to use. To plot the data we have not the choice because the google map api is written in javascript. The backend is 50% python and 50% javascript.

# How to use it ?

For the moment you can filter with 7 parameters (many more are coming). Just fill those parameters and click to see the map.
